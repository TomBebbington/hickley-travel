			<p>We have an unrivalled team of coach drivers here at Hickley Travel. All our coach drivers have the Driver Certificate of Professional Competence. We ensure that all drivers update their driving skills and knowledge each year.</p>
			<h2>Joanne Jordan</h2>
			<p>Jo is our most recent recruit. She has passed the advanced driving certificate. She also holds the NVQ level 3 Qualification in Road Passenger Vehicle Driving - the first driver to pass this qualification in our area. Jo is used to driving the distances which our tours cover. She looks forward to getting to know the passengers on each tour that she takes charge of. Jo's main interests are rock climbing and Salsa dancing.</p>
			<h2>William Palmer</h2>
			<p>Will is our longest serving driver. He has been with the company for 15 years. Will has the most experience of any of our team. He is very knowledgeable about the areas that his tours visit. Will is a member of the Hickley Conservation Group. You will find him helpful and he is always making jokes in conversations. At least Will calls them jokes!</p>
			<h2>Andy Serento</h2>
			<p>We are fortunate to have Andy on our staff. He joined the company four years ago from a rival tour company. He brings with him the experience of taking coach tours all around the UK. Andy is unflappable and always has a smile and a kind word for passengers. In addition he is very involved with martial arts and holds a Judo black belt, which is just the thing if there are any awkward situations to be dealt with.</p>
